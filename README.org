This is my archive of presentations related to the SKA project at
ZHAW.  The presentation source files are written in Emacs' ~org-mode~
and exported to HTML using ~org-reveal~ (using the ~reveal.js~ library
and my customized CSS style sheets, see
[[https://github.com/phdenzel/reveal.js][https://github.com/phdenzel/reveal.js]]).

* Assets

To conserve storage and centralize resources such as images, videos,
or pdfs, each presentation folder has it's own assets folder
consisting of symlinks to the main ~./assets~ folder.


** TODO Movies

Movies will be stored in the cloud and can be pulled using ~make
assets/movies~.
