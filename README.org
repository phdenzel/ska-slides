This is my archive of presentations related to the SKA project at
ZHAW.  The presentation source files are written in Emacs' ~org-mode~
and exported to HTML using ~org-reveal~ (using the ~reveal.js~ library
and my customized CSS style sheets, see
[[https://github.com/phdenzel/reveal.js][https://github.com/phdenzel/reveal.js]]).


* Presentations [2/3]

- [ ] ~colloq_intro2astro~: An introductory talk for peers @ ZHAW about
  Astrophysics, Machine Learning, and the Square Kilometer Array
- [X] ~meeting_slides/221028~: Meeting with Carolyn Crichton
- [X] ~meeting_slides/220803~: Initial SKA meeting @ ZHAW


* Assets

To conserve storage and centralize resources such as images, videos,
or pdfs, each presentation folder has it's own assets folder
consisting of symlinks to the main ~./assets~ folder.


** TODO Movies

Movies will be stored in the cloud and can be pulled using ~make
assets/movies~.
